00;00;01;05 - 00;00;19;26
Speaker 1
All right, we're back talking about money now, focusing on money actually in and this is why we talk about the four basics or the five basics, which is master the four basics. That's the fifth basic master the four basics. Who do you listen to?

00;00;22;04 - 00;00;46;24
Speaker 1
Teach, ability, index, training, balance, scale, and the four steps. You can see how. And that is the foundation of everything we're learning here. Because if we understand those concepts and we'll learn how to apply these concepts better. The training balance scale says on one side, it's the why, the thinking, the thoughts, the motivation, the attitude, and the other side is the how.

00;00;46;25 - 00;01;28;09
Speaker 1
The techniques. The skills. The methods. Strategies. The actions. The doing. We pointed out that 99.9% of making money or getting anything that you want or having being or doing anything in your life and creating anything and everything in your life. 99.9% of it is the thoughts. It's using your brain to put out a vibration. And then, by law of attraction, the universe will give you circumstances, situations and events and people to create that and bring into you, into your life that which you're vibrating.

00;01;29;03 - 00;01;56;24
Speaker 1
But it will give you event situations, people which match the feeling to give you matching feelings. This is why people always say, I wasn't vibrating. I was in thinking about a car crash. I wasn't thinking about falling down the stairs. No, but whatever feeling that event gave you, that's what you were vibrating your vibrating that emotion and feeling.

00;01;58;07 - 00;02;27;00
Speaker 1
Now you can create a specific thing, vibrate, vibration, but when you're putting that out, the universe will give you circumstances, events, situations and people which match your feeling that you're vibrating. That's what we have to be aware of. Now, when we're talking about money, how do we apply this to money? Because I am going to give you a couple specific hows or techniques and things that I'm going to do.

00;02;27;13 - 00;02;49;12
Speaker 1
However, the action steps are really not that relevant, and because there are virtually millions of different scenarios to make money, it's really stupid and impossible for somebody to say, I'm going to teach you a specific way to make money, because the method that I would teach may apply to you but may not apply to you. It may be something you really enjoy and want, but you wouldn't.

00;02;50;23 - 00;03;12;11
Speaker 1
So more important is for you to find the various methods and techniques of making money that you want, that give you the feeling that you want, and the universe will bring that into your life. But I'm going to give you some things to help you think about some certain things and focus on some certain things so you can bring into your life those certain things.

00;03;13;00 - 00;03;59;24
Speaker 1
So the first most important thing about making money is to want money. That's the first most important thing. You must want it specifically money at whatever level you choose. Again, the first rule or the first step of the force, that procedure is define what you want. So if you want money, how much money do you want? That amount, again, has to be a number that when you think about it, you feel good.

00;04;00;18 - 00;04;20;28
Speaker 1
If you feel bad, that means it's out of the sweet spot. Because if you come up with a number, I want $1,000,000 and you think about that, but you feel bad. That means you're not ready to focus on that. Because you're going to be pulled to thinking about the lack of it. And how am I going to get that?

00;04;21;03 - 00;04;55;11
Speaker 1
That'll never happen to me. And then you're focusing on that and you know that because you're feeling bad and you'll draw in more of lack. So everybody's amount of money is different. Some of you may say, I just want to I just want a certain amount of money to help start paying down my debt. You need to come up with a dollar amount of money that you want that you can focus on initially that you feel good about.

00;04;55;16 - 00;05;19;17
Speaker 1
Now, some of you may be able to use a more general approach instead of a specific amount and saying, I just want some more money so I can relieve some of my financial pressure. And so you may be able to think about more money. And when you think about just some money, some any amounts, fine, just some money to help relieve some pressure.

00;05;19;27 - 00;05;48;04
Speaker 1
Maybe that is your sweet spot and you don't have to come up with a specific amount at all. And some of you may even take a different approach. And going, I just want to feel financially secure and financially free without coming up with a specific amount. And oh, you're now working on a feeling. I remember the three ways you can define your dream or define your goal or define your want is with specificity a specific dollar amount.

00;05;48;19 - 00;06;13;10
Speaker 1
I want 10,000 a month. I want 50,000. I want 100,000. I want a million. I want 50 million. I want 100 million. I want a billion. Whatever the dollar amount is, that's with specificity with no time limit attached. The second way is general. I just want some money. Some more money to do a certain thing. And the third one is just a feeling.

00;06;13;21 - 00;06;54;06
Speaker 1
I want to feel secure in my finances. I want to feel financially free. Now, by the way, when you're focusing on this, you wouldn't say, I want to feel no burdens financially. I don't want to feel any more financial pressure. That can't be a goal because whatever you think about, you'll get. If you're feeling if you're thinking about a goal of, I don't want to feel financial pressure, you're thinking about financial pressure.

00;06;54;06 - 00;07;21;16
Speaker 1
You understand that. If you say, I don't want to have any more financial burdens, you're thinking about financial burdens. Now, this doesn't this applies to everything. When you think of anything you want, you must think of what you want, not what you don't want. If you're looking at a relationship, for example, you can't say, okay, I want a person who doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

00;07;21;18 - 00;07;50;02
Speaker 1
No, because you're going to you're thinking about a person who's smoking and drinking. That's the vibration because you're focusing on that. You would rather say, I want a person who lives a very healthy lifestyle like me. So you must always put wants, desires, dreams, goals in the positive. Don't say I want somebody who doesn't do this or I want no more of this or I don't want this.

00;07;50;11 - 00;08;14;11
Speaker 1
So some people, when they say, Tell me what you want in life, well, I don't want to be overweight anymore. No, you want to be thin. See the difference? I want to stop having food cravings. No. You want to have a normal appetite? I don't want any more stress. No. You want to feel secure and content and relaxed.

00;08;15;24 - 00;08;45;02
Speaker 1
Do you understand? You always must put your wants, goals, dreams and desires in the affirmative, in the positive sense. That way, you're focusing on what you want. So always remember that. So you have three ways of figuring out your financial goal, a specific amount. And this will change from time to time as you go through the process. So over the next days, weeks and months, you'll start changing this and always be changing it and fine tuning it.

00;08;45;24 - 00;09;12;08
Speaker 1
You're always fine tuning your dreaming and what you want because you're experiencing things that you don't want and you're fine tuning what you want. It becomes clearer, therefore, your vibration is clearer, more specific in your vibration. Either it's more specific on the feeling or more specific on the desire, and the more specific you can get on the feeling or the desire or even the general sense, it does actually become more specific.

00;09;12;08 - 00;09;51;19
Speaker 1
It becomes more powerful, more intense, and you get a higher level of belief, which means it comes into your existence faster. So the first thing is you must have a chief aim. Chief aim means a primary focused goal when it comes to money. One of the keys of wanting things, if you go back of everything we talked about, it's you become what you think about most of the time, which means if you really want things in your life, people always talk about a balanced life.

00;09;51;19 - 00;10;11;01
Speaker 1
You want a great relationship, you want great health, you want a great family. You want great social life. You want great intellectual stimulation. You want great emotions. You want great finances. You want a great career. You want to be fulfilled. Well, if you're thinking of all these things throughout the day, the question is, what are you thinking about?

00;10;11;01 - 00;10;36;15
Speaker 1
Most of the time the answer is you're not focusing on anything. You're putting up so many different vibrations. All these vibrations are good, but none of them therefore can be very intense, very powerful, and none of them can be being broadcast out of your brain for a long duration. One of the secret keys that nobody will talk about, because they always talk about this balance life.

00;10;37;11 - 00;11;02;26
Speaker 1
One of the secret keys we learned in society is that you become what you think about most of the time, and the key is you can't live a balanced life. You must be focusing on a chief aim most of the time. If that's your health, that's your health. If that's your family, that's your family. If that's your finances, that's your finances.

00;11;03;13 - 00;11;24;03
Speaker 1
If it's your relationship, it's your relationship. If your intellectual pursuits that your intellectual pursuits you become what you think about most of the time. Therefore, you must always have a chief aim. Some of you right now, if you look at the very various areas of your life, you really have to ask yourself, what is your chief aim? Is it finances?

00;11;24;27 - 00;11;52;17
Speaker 1
Is it relationship? Is it health? Is it your spouse? Is it your career? Is it your intellectual pursuits? What is your chief aim? And the fact is, you can be broadcasting all those things. Yes, but you must have a chief aim. This was taught to Napoleon Hill by Andrew Carnegie, and it's something that has been overlooked throughout history.

00;11;54;03 - 00;12;26;17
Speaker 1
Another way of putting it is and this may sound negative, but it's true. You must be obsessed with what you want, because that's the only way you can focus your broadcasting vibration. You must be obsessed with what you want. That's the only way you can continually clarify it. Broadcast the vibration with power and intensity and have the duration long enough to create it in your life.

00;12;26;27 - 00;12;55;01
Speaker 1
You must be obsessed. You get what you think about most of the time. So if you're putting equal amounts of effort or equal amount of thought across 20 different things, all those things will ultimately come into your life in varying levels and degrees. But if you want something to really come into your life fast, you must broadcast it virtually all the time.

00;12;55;20 - 00;13;20;10
Speaker 1
Which means you must be thinking about it all the time or most of the time. You become what you think about most of the time. You must have a burning desire. Remember Napoleon Hill. Define your goal. And later he called it. Define your chief aim. And he later said, Define what you're going to be thinking about and what you want all the time.

00;13;21;02 - 00;13;40;03
Speaker 1
Define what you want and think about it all the time and have a burning desire for its achievement. What's burning desire? Burning desire is massive obsession. Think you can't have a burning desire for something if you're not thinking about it all the time, then you don't really have a burning desire for it. You need to be obsessed with it.

00;13;40;15 - 00;14;10;15
Speaker 1
You need to be talking about it, thinking about it, living it, breathing it, tasting it, touching it, anticipating it as if it's already yours. You become what you think about most of the time. You need to define your chief aim and become obsessed with it and focus on it all the time. That's how you create it. Tiger Woods greatest golfer golfer that ever lived is obsessed with golf since he was a little kid.

00;14;11;16 - 00;14;43;09
Speaker 1
Yes, he doesn't have a balanced life. If you look at all the great athletes, all the great musicians, all the great people in any area that have achieved greatness, they don't have balanced life. Now, somebody said, well, I don't want that. I want a balanced life. That's fine, and that's very good. So you can make good money and have a good relationship and be happy and have a nice family life and have a nice social life and a nice church life and all these different things and have a wonderful, balanced life.

00;14;43;10 - 00;15;05;18
Speaker 1
That's a good chief aim. Your chief aim could be, I want to have a balanced life. I want to be really balanced and enjoy so many different things in my life. That's perfect. If you want to make massive amounts of money, or if you want to have this spectacular physique, or if you want to have the most brilliant relationship in the world, that has to be your chief aim.

00;15;05;18 - 00;15;28;01
Speaker 1
That means you're going to be a little bit unbalanced. You're going to be focused on and obsessed with that one thing, which is your chief aim. Chief aim is overlooked. Obsession is never talked about. But the fact is you must have a magnificent obsession. If that's something you really, really desire in order to get something, you have to think about it all the time.

00;15;28;09 - 00;15;46;23
Speaker 1
You must define what you want and have a burning desire for achievement, which means you're obsessed with it, which means you're thinking about it all the time and feeling good when you're thinking about it, and then feeling good throughout the day and thinking about it all the time. When you're feeling good all the time because you're thinking about it all the time and every time you're thinking about it, you're feeling good.

00;15;47;01 - 00;16;10;10
Speaker 1
Guess what's going to happen? You're going to get exactly what you want with record speed. That's how it works. It isn't the actions of the activities. It's the vibration that will create the event situations, people, and circumstances in your life that make it happen. And then the actions you do. Working on your chief aim, you will categorically 100% be thrilled and enjoy that activity.

00;16;10;26 - 00;16;32;12
Speaker 1
If you're not enjoying the activity, that means you're not feeling good. That means you're thinking of the lack of it and you're doubting you'll get it and you're not going to get it. Makes sense. So first and foremost, you must be obsessed when it comes to money. You must think about either a specific amount of money you want with no time limit attached.

00;16;33;03 - 00;16;55;12
Speaker 1
Be generally that you want money to do certain things to buy a new house, to get a down payment. I need I need an increase in cash to free me up or thirdly, a complete generalization of how money's going to make you feel or how you want to feel in relation to money. I want to feel financially free.

00;16;55;24 - 00;17;20;08
Speaker 1
I want to feel financially secure. I want to have enough money. So I feel completely empowered. And to be able to do whatever I want, whenever I want, I want to have enough money to do whatever I want, whenever I want, and be free. So you're looking for a feeling either one of those three areas is how you define it.

00;17;20;13 - 00;17;44;06
Speaker 1
This makes sense and you use the same technique. You think about what you want with power and intensity. You must feel good about when you think about your goal and the techniques that are help you think about it all the time are get it pictures of what you want or what the money's going to give you. This is why your dream board is good.

00;17;44;19 - 00;18;04;09
Speaker 1
The dream book is good because if you want lots of money to do a lot of things, looking at all the things that you could achieve if money wasn't an object. Looking at that on a regular basis will help remind you to think about money, money, money, money, money. I'm bringing in money and feeling the anticipation and exhilaration as if you already have it.

00;18;06;03 - 00;18;31;23
Speaker 1
You become what you think about all the time. Just looking at a picture over and over and over again and feeling good about looking at pictures of cars, jewelry, clothes, exotic locations you want to travel to. If money is your goal. Having pictures on the ceiling when you go to bed so you can see them right before you go to bed at night on the mirror when you wake up on your house.

00;18;32;09 - 00;18;58;28
Speaker 1
The actual process of creating those pictures and those images keeps you focused on it and gets you excited and allows you to broadcast from your brain the visor in your car, in your office, on your computer, so that you're looking at these things all the time, having your dream book written out and reading those dreams of what you want throughout the day causes you to focus.

00;18;59;01 - 00;19;23;29
Speaker 1
See, in the beginning, you're doing this because it's a conscious competence level. Going dream building allows you to focus on things constantly. Going out there in terms of money, dream building, looking at things, touching them, sitting in the car, feeling how you're going to feel when that car is yours. Looking at homes. Watching Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

00;19;24;16 - 00;19;53;22
Speaker 1
The Travel Channel about luxury yacht to whatever. Start expanding. Now you may say, well, I'm watching luxury yachts, but I don't want one. Perfectly fine. But what you're saying is money is available. Other people are getting money. Your belief level goes up that it can happen by doing this process. This makes sense. So 99.9% about making millions. The success secret that they don't want you to know about is that it's all in the mind.

00;19;54;28 - 00;20;28;00
Speaker 1
This is what they the elite class, don't want you to know. The major secret is that you must have a burning desire and obsession with making money. You must be thinking about making money all the time and feel good about it. And that's 99.9% of the secret of making money and becoming wealthy. When Andrew Carnegie, the richest man in the world, wrote the book Thinking Grow Rich, it would be when Andrew Carnegie taught this information to Napoleon Hill, who wrote the book Thinking Grow Rich.

00;20;28;26 - 00;20;58;16
Speaker 1
The name of the book was entitled Think and Grow Rich Not Work Hard and Grow Rich Not You must be smart and grow rich. Not You must know the right people and grow rich. It was think in Grow Rich because what Andrew Carnegie, the richest man in the world, taught Napoleon Hill was It's all about thinking if people who are rich work hard, they're not working.

00;20;58;16 - 00;21;22;19
Speaker 1
They are doing what they love. They're enjoying every step. Carnegie, for example, at the turn of the century, built US steel. What people don't know. He went to the office at ten in the morning on a monday. He'd leave it for the afternoon. They didn't have telephones, BlackBerrys, laptops. So he did his business from 10 to 4. He took a lunch and he went home and he had dinner every night.

00;21;22;25 - 00;21;53;06
Speaker 1
All nights and weekends. He was not working. And in the summer, he took three months off and he went to Scotland and he did no work, no phones, no telex, no fax machines, no emails, no instant messaging, no cell phones. He was somebody who, quote, did not put in a lot of physical effort, but he became the richest man in the world because he understood the power, because he was a member of the Brotherhood, that 99.9% of success is created in the mind.

00;21;54;07 - 00;22;18;10
Speaker 1
When you put out that vibration, it attracts itself into its life and creates people circumstances, events and situations to give you exactly what you want. Now, if you believe that you have to work seven days a week, 20 hours a day to become successful, guess what then? It's true. Henry Ford said it this way because he was also a member.

00;22;19;10 - 00;22;52;13
Speaker 1
He said, if you think you can or if you think you can't. Either way, you're correct. It's the thinking that makes it so. It's the thinking that makes it so. So if you believe in, you're putting out well, you know, you can't be successful unless you work really hard. That's the vibration you're putting out, which means the universe is going to give back to you and put in your life circumstances, events, situations, and people which will prove that you must work hard and long hours in order to be successful.

00;22;54;06 - 00;23;15;04
Speaker 1
If you put out I know that the Law of Attraction works and 99.9% of making money is just thoughts. Therefore, I don't have to work that hard. And if I do put in a lot of hours only because I'm absolutely enjoying it and loving every minute of it, but it's not required, then the universe will put into your life circumstances, events and situations and people which will prove that that's true.

00;23;16;25 - 00;23;41;19
Speaker 1
Does that make sense? It is the thinking that makes it so. So 99% about making money is this technique. We could end the seminar right here and go. Hey, that's how you get rich. You basically define what you want, how much money you want, or a general amount of money you want, or a feeling about money. Focus on it all the time, become obsessed with it.

00;23;41;19 - 00;23;57;25
Speaker 1
Get a burning desire for its achievement. And when you think about it, you feel great. You feel exhilaration and anticipation like it's already in a box, it's already in the present, it's got your name on it and it's under the tree. And when Christmas comes, it's yours. You know it. No one's taken it away from you. It's there.

00;23;58;02 - 00;24;27;22
Speaker 1
You just do that and you'll get all your dreams come true. When it comes to finances. That's the key. That is the magic. That's the secret. Isn't that interesting? Now I'm going to give you a list of some things here. These are some techniques, some methods, some strategies. Here are some of the how. None of these are required.

00;24;27;22 - 00;24;52;13
Speaker 1
None. None are required at all. But here are some things that you may want to think about and consider, which will help hopefully raise your level of belief and cut down the curve. Because now you'll have knowledge of some of the things that could be helpful to you. But these are not required to make money. The only thing that's required is what I just told you.

00;24;53;03 - 00;25;20;22
Speaker 1
Get a chief aim regarding money. Focus on it. Use the law of Attraction. It's the secret that Napoleon Hill shared in the law of Success. Andrew Carnegie. Henry Ford. Thomas Edison. Albert Einstein. Every Super successful people in the world uses that one technique. There's a U.S. News and World Report Collectors Edition. I have it in front of me called Secrets of the Super Rich, the 15 all time richest Americans.

00;25;20;25 - 00;25;45;13
Speaker 1
Modern Moguls an inside look and then this. And in this book, you can see it here. Seven Secrets of the Super Rich. And here's the first secret. I'll just read off this. You can you can get this magazine if you want. And keep in mind, this is not 1,000% accurate, because this is written by a journalist who talked to and observed these people, but they didn't share the truth.

00;25;45;18 - 00;26;07;02
Speaker 1
Just so you know that, remember I told you, who do you listen to? But I'll point these out to you. What they have is the seven secrets. Perseverance beats education. It doesn't take superhuman intelligence to become super rich. Bottom line is supposed to people think, I have to be smart to be rich now. Throughout history, superhuman intelligence doesn't matter.

00;26;07;15 - 00;26;27;23
Speaker 1
It's perseverance. And what is perseverance or perseverance is basically being obsessed with what you want, believing you're going to get it and not giving up, which means get a chief aim and focus on what you want all the time. You become or you get what you think about most of the time. Number two Make your own luck. Create your own luck.

00;26;28;05 - 00;26;51;05
Speaker 1
How do you create your own luck? The universe gives it to you when you're focusing on what you want. Moneywise believe you're going to get it. You have complete anticipation and you're focusing on it all the time. The universe gives you all lucky circumstances and situations in your life. Three Gamble. But wisely, they talk about the fact that these people follow their feelings.

00;26;51;26 - 00;27;10;12
Speaker 1
They make decisions and choices based on feelings. If it feels good, if they feel good about doing it without fear or anticipation, which means they're not thinking about what they don't want to happen, they're thinking about what they do want to happen. When they do things, they do things based on how it makes them feel. Am I going to go in this direction?

00;27;10;18 - 00;27;29;03
Speaker 1
Am I going to invest here? Am I going to try this business? If they're feeling great about it, it always works because that's you predicting the future, because you're creating the future to somebody else. It looks like a gamble, but nobody else can know how you feel. So if you're about to do something and you're feeling bad about it, don't do it.

00;27;29;04 - 00;27;49;28
Speaker 1
It may be the most brilliant idea in the world, and it may actually work. But the fact that you're feeling bad about it, which means your doubt level is high, your belief is low, and you're thinking about it. Not working means even if it's a brilliant idea, it won't work. You must follow your feelings for know your market intimately.

00;27;50;27 - 00;28;25;16
Speaker 1
What it means here is it talks about is they associate with people and circuit and in situations that that revolve around what their particular market is and so they know their business intimately and intimately. When you read the article and you talk to these people is they have a sense of feeling about the market. And all this means is when they think about doing things in their particular business, they're following their feelings, which is how it works.

00;28;26;10 - 00;28;43;00
Speaker 1
It's not about you have to be smart. You have to know every detail because it's irrelevant. You get out of the things stage and you use the feeling stage because when your attitudes right, the facts don't count anyway. Because if you're going to do something, even though all the facts say that this won't work, but you're feeling it, it will work.

00;28;43;00 - 00;29;15;12
Speaker 1
It will work because that's the law of attraction. Number five, focus obsessively. While they do use the word obsessive, focus obsessively and work, work, work, focus obsessively, which means have a aim, put the blinders on. Think about what you want to happen all the time. Which when you do that with anticipation, it says work, work, work. It's because the effort you put in will be so much pleasure.

00;29;15;19 - 00;29;37;21
Speaker 1
You'll want to do it all the time. Six. Timing is everything. Now, it's interesting when Bill Gates was being interviewed on Larry King Live, they asked them, Bill, you're one of the richest men in the world. What's the secret to success? He said, Well, basically a couple of things, Larry. He says, first, the depth of vision. You have to see the future.

00;29;37;21 - 00;29;59;13
Speaker 1
You have to know exactly what you want. He goes, Let me give you an example. He said, When I was looking at the computer business, there's a lot of people that saw the computer business, but they didn't see the potential in the computer business. So you have to see the potential in things. And that is really going beyond looking at what you see.

00;29;59;22 - 00;30;15;21
Speaker 1
But look at what it could become and I'll give you all the example here. Years and years ago, I was in Denver, Colorado, and I was talking to the past president of one of the largest corporations in America. And I asked him, you know, what is one of his secrets of success? And he said, depth of vision. And I said, What do you mean?

00;30;16;00 - 00;30;34;10
Speaker 1
He says, Well, just don't look at things as they are. Look at them as how they could become have depth of vision. And he gave me an example. He said, Kevin, make believe you're looking at an acorn. And he said, Look at that acorn. And with depth of vision, what do you really see? And I said, Ah, if I say food for squirrels, I flunked the test.

00;30;35;12 - 00;31;03;13
Speaker 1
So I said, I don't see an acorn, I see a tree. He says, Very good. He goes, You know, I see I see a forest. I see depth of vision. And I go, I get it. I don't see a forest. I see houses and buildings all over the world from the wood. Do you understand from that? That's called depth of vision, seeing things further down the track.

00;31;04;15 - 00;31;33;17
Speaker 1
But when Bill Gates was on, Larry King's was at first depth of vision. And then he said, timing. You have to be at the right place at the right time. He said, luck has a lot to do with that. Now luck is created. So when you want something and focused on it obsessively, the universe will give you circumstances, situations, events and people.

00;31;34;12 - 00;31;57;28
Speaker 1
In other words, the universe will put you at the right place at the right time. And then Bill Gates said, But a lot of people had the same vision I did. A lot of people were at the same place I was. The big difference is I took action. And this is one thing the universe will present to you circumstances, events and situations.

00;31;58;09 - 00;32;21;10
Speaker 1
But it will be up to you to go with your feeling and do something and take action when it's presented. And the story goes about the minister who was in Louisiana at the church when the floods were coming and they evacuated the town and the minister said, no, no, no, I don't have to be evacuated because God's going to take care of me.

00;32;22;05 - 00;32;37;15
Speaker 1
So he stood there at the church, but the water continued to rise and rise and rise. So a boat came by and said to the preacher, preacher, we evacuated the whole town. Why don't you hop in this boat and let's get out of here. You know, this is dangerous. And the preacher said, no, God's going to take care of me.

00;32;37;16 - 00;33;08;06
Speaker 1
I'm not worried. Well, a little while later, the waters continued to rise and rise and rise. Another boat came by and said, Preacher, you know, this is getting worse. It isn't getting better. We're here to rescue you. He says, No, I am committed to staying because God's going to take care of me. So the boat left while the waters continue to rise and the preacher was on the roof of the of the chapel and a helicopter came by and said, Preacher, it's getting worse.

00;33;08;06 - 00;33;28;09
Speaker 1
It ain't getting better. You know, you could die here if it rises any more. And the preacher said, Nope, God's going to take care of me. I'm sure everything's going to be fine with the water continue to rise and the preacher drowned. And when he was up in heaven, dead, Saint Peter was there. And the preacher was mad.

00;33;28;09 - 00;33;52;17
Speaker 1
The preacher said, I don't understand this. I believe in the Bible. I believed in God. I thought God was going to take care of me, but I died. What happened? And Saint Peter said, You idiot, we sent you two boats in a helicopter. You understand that? So in your life, circumstances and situations will present himself and a lot of people are just not paying attention.

00;33;52;23 - 00;34;18;25
Speaker 1
You're wanting something and wanting something and wanting something and wanting something, and all of a sudden, boom, they come into your life or it comes into your life or circumstance comes into your life and you're not taking action. So you must take action. Seven It's not just or even mostly about the money people that are super wealthy. No, it's not really about the money.

00;34;19;08 - 00;34;42;04
Speaker 1
When you read this, it's about the feeling. So they're really working on how they want to feel. They want to feel as a creator. They want to feel as somebody who's adding value to society. They want to feel an accomplishment. And the money really is secondary. And this is a great little book that talks about the richest people of all time in America.

00;34;42;13 - 00;35;05;07
Speaker 1
And it's only Americans. I know most of you here aren't even from America, from all over the world. Those who are listening to the CDs are all over the world as well. So we're just dealing with this American particular thing. But in America, the top 50, 15 richest Americans of all time, one John de Rockefeller worth $303 billion, Andrew Carnegie 281 billion.

00;35;05;07 - 00;35;40;10
Speaker 1
At the time, Andrew was the richest man in the world, but John took over that later with oil. Cornelius Vanderbilt 168 billion. Bill Gates. John Jacob Astor. And it goes on. Richard Mellon. Frederick Where Hauser. Marshall Field. Sam Walton. Jay Gould. Henry Ford. Andrew Mellon. Warren Buffett. All these people. If you pick up the Forbes 400 and look at the 400 richest people in the world, all of them all are using the techniques that I'm sharing with you today.

00;35;41;12 - 00;36;08;29
Speaker 1
This is not Guru Land. This is not some fictional fantasy. This is what everybody is using, period. End of story. And if you think you're going to achieve money by not using this, the answer is yes. You can to varying degrees, but not really. Because even if you do everything different, what basically is happening is you are putting out a vibration of some money and the vibration is what's making you the money.

00;36;09;07 - 00;36;27;18
Speaker 1
It isn't anything else you're doing, it's the vibration you may think it's the effort. It may think it's the genius that you are and how smart you are and how persuasive and how many good skills you have. None of that really matters. The fact is, what's really making the money in your life? You may think it's everything else, but it's the fact that you are putting out a vibration.

00;36;27;18 - 00;36;47;05
Speaker 1
You're thinking about what you want and you're vibrating it in the universe, putting it into your life. You may think it's this, but it's not. It's the thought process. Whether you're conscious doing it or just doing it automatically. But when you ask anybody, Do you know about the Law of Attraction? Nope. Okay. But you know, you make half a million bucks a year.

00;36;47;05 - 00;37;09;21
Speaker 1
Yeah. Okay. Why do you think you're so successful and you start talking to them at the end of the day, like I've talked to these people, at the end of the day, they're all doing the same thing. They're thinking about exactly what they want all the time, and they feel good when they think about it. That is the technique that they're all using, whether they know it or not.

00;37;09;21 - 00;37;31;25
Speaker 1
So that's number one. So let me give you a couple things to jot down, and then I'm going to focus on just a couple little bits and bobs so I can kind of point you in the right direction. But the key is you must be thinking about the money all the time, if that's what you want. And some of you think, Well, I really don't want to make millions, I just want to make a little bit more.

00;37;32;04 - 00;37;54;12
Speaker 1
I just want to make enough money to get out of debt. Fine. Focus On that, there's no there's no requirement. You're not less of a person if you're not rich. As a matter of fact, the only thing that's important in your life is that you're happy and feeling joy and fulfillment. It doesn't make a difference if you're $100 million in debt.

00;37;54;24 - 00;38;11;11
Speaker 1
It doesn't make a difference if you file bankruptcy. Does it make a difference if you have to live in a tent for a while? Heck, I pay big money to go fishing in Canada and I'm living in poverty like a third world country and I have the best time in the world. I remember the first time I went fishing for three days.

00;38;11;11 - 00;38;34;11
Speaker 1
I stayed there three weeks. I was having so much fun and I was living virtually like a pauper, but having the most joyous, wonderful time in the world. So it's not about the things or the money or the homes or the cars. It's about a feeling inside you're looking for. That's what life is really all about. And you will have desires to do things to achieve.

00;38;34;11 - 00;39;04;29
Speaker 1
You will have desires to create, you'll have desires to add value to society, to work with children, help other people. And that's what life is really all about. Money is only one part, but some of you also right now have desires of making money, making 100,000 a year or 300,000 a year, or making $100,000 a month. And some you can't even think that far when you think about it.

00;39;04;29 - 00;39;34;29
Speaker 1
There's just no belief whatsoever. But the fact is, there are lots of people making $1,000,000 a year and there's lots of people, you know, just a few years ago, there were in America, about 15 billionaires. Now there's like 500 and around the world that there are there are thousands more around the world that are certified. And believe me, the real money, nobody even knows their names.

00;39;34;29 - 00;40;03;18
Speaker 1
But it is available, not a requirement. You can have, be or do anything you want, whatever it is. So here's a few things to consider in terms of making money. First and foremost, again, when you think about the money, the universe will give you circumstances and events and people and situations that will put you will put it in your life, which will give you what you want.

00;40;04;15 - 00;40;31;00
Speaker 1
But there are a couple of things to consider about making money. First is, if you are employed by somebody, you're pretty much limited on the amount of money you can make. And the reason I bring some of these things up is because when circumstances and events come to you, you may not be aware that this is the right offer being presented to you because you may not know that this is a boat and it is here to rescue you.

00;40;31;27 - 00;40;53;01
Speaker 1
You may not be aware of that. So a couple of things. If you really want to make some good money, you need to consider that your job is not really the place for making serious money. Yes, you can use this technique to get raises, to get promotions and increase your earning power at your position. No question about that.

00;40;54;04 - 00;41;30;16
Speaker 1
But real money is going to come from either a business of your own or your own company. Now there is a difference between a business of your own in your own company. A business of your own is a business that you own, such as a florist, a restaurant, a dry cleaner, anything that's a business. So you having a business of your own allows you to make a lot more money than being in a job.

00;41;30;22 - 00;42;08;15
Speaker 1
Generally speaking, unless you're a major CEO or, a major executive or director, and when you're getting stock options and so forth and so on. So using the technique in your current situation, you can the universe can create circumstances and events in your current job to make any money you want, no question. But if you're using the technique, the universe may also put into your into your experience, business opportunities or other methods of making money, which you should not potentially fufu and and just say to the boat, go away because it is a boat coming maybe to save you.

00;42;09;19 - 00;42;57;04
Speaker 1
So a business of your own is, is some type of business that you're there generating. A company is your own company which generates money. And it does so generally in such things as investments. In investments could be in the stock market, commodities markets, trading markets, real estate or investing in other people's companies. So a business of your own could be an Internet based business, could be a multi-level marketing home based business, a part time type business, a real brick and mortar business like a restaurant that's a business of your own businesses, of your own.

00;42;57;29 - 00;43;22;14
Speaker 1
There are home based businesses and real what we call brick and mortar businesses. There are full time businesses and there are part time there, businesses that require lots of capital. And there are businesses that don't require lots of money to start. There are businesses that require a lot of experience, knowledge and time. And there are part time businesses that don't require lots of knowledge or time.

00;43;23;07 - 00;43;51;06
Speaker 1
So depending on your situation, these are the situations that may come into your experience. So you must be aware that having a business of your own or having your own company earning money is something that is a way generate huge amounts of revenue and wealth. That's number one. And I will give you one other little tidbit here. When it comes to making money, there are two ways to make money.

00;43;51;06 - 00;44;33;10
Speaker 1
One is you earn money, which means you go out and make money. Your effort makes you money. Nothing wrong with that. It can be incredibly pleasurable, lots of fun. And those are the people that are really having a great time. However, there is a limit to the amount of time and effort you can do each day, which means when you are earning money based on your own efforts, even in a business of your own or your own company, because let's say you have your own company trading or let's say of your own company as a restaurant or let's say of your own company doing a service such as an accounting firm.

00;44;33;10 - 00;45;06;11
Speaker 1
It is your own business and you're doing a service and these companies require your effort to earn money. So when you're earning money based on your own efforts, your money is limited to a degree. So what some people do is they what's called duplicate their efforts. If they have an accounting business and there is a one man accounting firm, they their own business, they decide to hire some additional accountants and therefore they're duplicating their efforts.

00;45;07;27 - 00;45;36;04
Speaker 1
So those are the two ways in business when you're earning money, the other way is rather than you earn money. The other method is when money is working for you instead of you working for money. Money is working for you. This is basic investing. This is when you have money and you put money into a business. And without your efforts, that money begins to grow.

00;45;36;20 - 00;46;00;28
Speaker 1
Or you have money in some type of investment vehicle where that money each month gives you more money. That is how super wealth has been created. Now, a lot of you aren't at the super wealth mindset yet. You just want to make some money. But I'm just giving you this little tidbit because if I can plant the seed right now, this could be a desire.

00;46;01;13 - 00;46;19;29
Speaker 1
And even though it may not be a desire that you think about all the time or most of the time, it could be a desire that you begin to think about. Little by little of, I want to be at a place where I don't have to work. I don't want to be at a place. My money is giving me an income of 20, 30, 40, $50,000 a month.

00;46;20;22 - 00;46;39;29
Speaker 1
My money is working for me. And now I have complete financial freedom. And then I can start doing all types of different things travel. I can look at new businesses. I can learn how to paint. I can do all these different things. So maybe I'm planning that seed right now. So you're start transmitting that thought process. This is how it works.

00;46;41;16 - 00;47;04;10
Speaker 1
And then later that will become a reality for some of you. So that's the first concept. A couple of basic concepts you want to consider. None of these are required, but here are some things to consider. And the reason I'm giving them to you is I'm planting seeds. This is why last night somebody said, What the heck did you do to us?

00;47;05;05 - 00;47;26;09
Speaker 1
We are feeling so empowered and so confident and so fantastic because I'm in this lecture. What you don't know is I'm using certain language patterns which, is putting embedded commands for you to consider planting seeds, if you will. So you start thinking about them in a positive way. I'm giving you a lot of positive things to think about.

00;47;26;09 - 00;47;46;02
Speaker 1
I'm planning a lot of seeds doing it on purpose. There are a lot of techniques that I'm employing and these thoughts are beginning to Germany in many of you, and you're beginning to think about it just just a little bit as you think about it just a little. Your brain is putting up that vibration, which is causing an attraction of more like thoughts.

00;47;46;14 - 00;48;21;05
Speaker 1
And these thoughts are feel really good because the thought I'm giving you feels good. Therefore like feeling thoughts come in and they step out begins to build up. Which is why the more you listen to these CDs over and over and over and over and over and over again, and the other CDs that we're going to recommend and the more books that I recommend, if you become part of the Global Information Network and get the CDs every month in the books every month, if you purchased some of the other CD packages that we have that are going to suggest or come to some of these other seminars, it begins, we're planning so many seeds and

00;48;21;05 - 00;48;45;01
Speaker 1
getting your brain working almost on autopilot and you're beginning to attract more like minded thoughts. So I'm going to give you a couple of things to consider here. A couple concepts that will help you in terms of wealth creation making money. One, there should be a focus, as one of your chief aims, something that you're focusing on of getting out of debt.

00;48;46;03 - 00;49;25;12
Speaker 1
Now there's a difference between debt and credit. Debt is bad. Credit is good. Debt is basically owing lots of money that has been borrowed on depreciating assets or no assets at all. Basically what it means is you buy a car and you're paying on that car, and every year the car becomes less of less value. It goes down in value, but you keep paying on it.

00;49;25;12 - 00;50;03;05
Speaker 1
So you basically bought something, borrowed money, and every year what you purchased goes down in value. But you keep paying on it and you're paying interest. Credit card debt is debt. A home mortgage is not debt. That's credit because you purchase an appreciating asset. So credit is good debts or bad. Ideally, in order to free up the flow of energy and this is how energy flows when it comes to money, your thought process will flow much easier when you are winning.

00;50;03;05 - 00;50;27;10
Speaker 1
You have reduced your debt and you're on the way out of debt and you're only using credit. All the thoughts flow easier and energy around money flows easier. So an objective or a goal should be to reduce or get out of debt. And you can go to a website called Debt Cures dot com and there are a lot of other good websites and books on debt reduction and techniques and how to reduce debt.

00;50;28;23 - 00;50;49;29
Speaker 1
But debt, cars.com has a very good, good some good books on there and different materials. So consider getting out of debt and you all can get out of debt. You all can reduce your debt. You can reduce your debt by simply as using this technique saying I want to be debt free. Don't say I want to get out of debt because you're focusing on debt.

00;50;51;06 - 00;51;19;13
Speaker 1
Say, I want to have no bills. I want to be debt free. Next, you should consider starting right now saving 10% of what you earn. Just take 10% off the top of whatever you get and put it away in a savings account. You can put it in any type of investment vehicle you just put it in a savings account.

00;51;20;07 - 00;51;39;16
Speaker 1
You can use that money and buy gold or silver and just put that in a safe. You can use that money and just put it in a savings account and once, once every three months go and just buy some stocks or bonds and just keep it in an investment account. But you start shoveling away 10% and never touch it.

00;51;40;04 - 00;52;13;17
Speaker 1
This also frees up energy because it starts to increase your level of belief on the fact that you can start accumulating a net worth and some wealth. This little technique dramatically changes the way you think. It is very powerful. Start saving 10%. Next, you want to reduce how much taxes you pay. How do you do that? Well, first off, if you do form a corporation, you can reduce taxes in many cases.

00;52;14;13 - 00;52;33;09
Speaker 1
So you want to look at how much taxes you're paying and reduce the amount of taxes you pay because whatever you save in taxes is real cash in your hand that you can use to create more money. Next, you want to reduce your insurance premiums. If you just sit down and look at all the insurance premiums you pay.

00;52;33;22 - 00;53;00;10
Speaker 1
Review your policies and start doing some shopping. Every one of you can dramatically save money on your insurance premiums and all of your insurance premiums. I can guarantee you you're overpaying. So if you reduce the money you're spending on insurance premiums, that's extra cash you just got to raise. If you reduce taxes, which you can all do very easily, just have them reviewed or start a corporation.

00;53;00;10 - 00;53;36;05
Speaker 1
And if you reduce insurance premiums, you've all just gotten an instant, instant raise. Next, use corporations for credit lines and OPM, which stands for other people's money. When you start making money, you have to understand people always think, well, I don't have any money. You don't need any money to make money. When you form a corporation and you can go to a legal legal xoom dot com has all the forms there very inexpensively.

00;53;36;05 - 00;54;11;17
Speaker 1
You can form a corporation in any country in the world. There are major tax advantages of forming corporations, but corporations also allow you access to lines of credit that you wouldn't have as an individual person. So all of a sudden, instantaneously, you most people don't even know this. If you just form a corporation, you now have access to credit, not debt credit, which you didn't have access 5 minutes earlier, and you can get lines of credit up to $1,000,000, which is really something to consider.

00;54;11;21 - 00;54;45;11
Speaker 1
Next, there's a couple what we call character traits of people that have money and something you should consider working on. If you work on these character traits, you'll feel better and you'll attract more money in your life. One is develop a pleasing personality. There's a great book called How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. I would encourage all of you to take the Dale Carnegie course.

00;54;46;16 - 00;55;27;17
Speaker 1
When you develop a pleasing personality, you attract more and better people in your life. Whatever personality you have, you will attract like minded people. If you have a pleasing personality, you will attract like minded people. Things be easier in business. You'll get more accomplished with a pleasing personality. Next, work on improving your communication skills, your persuasive skills, your sales skills, and your negotiation skills in business.

00;55;27;26 - 00;55;53;09
Speaker 1
You will be using some of these skills. This is definitely on the right side of the training balance scale, the skills, the techniques. So there are some sales techniques, the Russian communication techniques. There are some persuasive techniques. For example, one communication technique, which is very powerful, is learn how to ask questions and listen. God gave you two ears and one mouth.

00;55;53;09 - 00;56;19;29
Speaker 1
Use them proportionately. So when you're meeting people talk less, listen more. And when you're asking questions, use the six honest serving men and use them until you die. They are what, when and where, who, how and why. I can give a whole again two days on communication or pleasing personality, and I'm gonna give you some books to review and look at.

00;56;20;16 - 01;03;34;01
Speaker 1
The reason we don't spend a lot of time with that in this particular session is it really is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things if you're doing the technique, because all this will automatically happen anyway. If I focused all my attention on this idea was a guy who very successful man.
